The Milldrew Soft Monorepo

This is the beginning of a monorepo which will contain multiple workspaces that 
will have multiple projects (libraries/applications) in a monorepo architecture.

• We will start with an angular workspace that will be managed by the angular 
  cli

• We will add a nestjs workspace that will be managed by the nestjs cli

• We will maintain a docker compose build that we can use to run the 
  application locally end to end

• We will use a cli like minikube or a similar one to run the application 
  locally on a k8 cluster.
